Philips ECG Wave Detection Library
Overview
This library is a comprehensive tool developed to facilitate the analysis and detection of waves on ECG (Electrocardiogram) echocardiogram data obtained from Philips Machines. The library provides a set of functions and utilities to process and extract meaningful information from ECG signals, with a primary focus on identifying and determining various waves in the signal.

Features
1. Wave Detection
The library includes robust algorithms for detecting key waves in an ECG signal, such as:

P-waves: Identifying atrial depolarization.
QRS-complex: Detecting ventricular depolarization.
T-waves: Capturing ventricular repolarization.
These detection algorithms are designed to handle diverse signal variations and noise commonly encountered in real-world ECG data.

2. Data Preprocessing
To enhance the accuracy of wave detection, the library includes preprocessing functions to clean and filter ECG signals. This involves noise reduction, baseline correction, and other techniques to improve signal quality.

3. Visualization
The library provides visualization tools for ECG signals, allowing users to observe the detected waves alongside the original signal. This aids in validation and fine-tuning of the detection parameters.

Usage:

import philips_ecg_wave_detection as ecg

# Load ECG data from a Philips Machine
ecg_data = ecg.load_data("path/to/ecg_file.philips")

# Preprocess the ECG data
preprocessed_data = ecg.preprocess(ecg_data)

# Detect waves in the ECG signal
detected_waves = ecg.detect_waves(preprocessed_data)

# Visualize the results
ecg.plot_results(ecg_data, detected_waves)


Refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions and additional functionalities.

-Python 2.7

Python 2.7, there are a few adjustments you need to make in terms of syntax and library compatibility. Below is a modified version of the README file specifically tailored for Python 2.7.

# Philips ECG Wave Detection Library

## Overview

This library is a comprehensive tool developed to facilitate the analysis and detection of waves on ECG (Electrocardiogram) echocardiogram data obtained from Philips Machines. The library provides a set of functions and utilities to process and extract meaningful information from ECG signals, with a primary focus on identifying and determining various waves in the signal.

## Features

### 1. Wave Detection

The library includes robust algorithms for detecting key waves in an ECG signal, such as:

- **P-waves:** Identifying atrial depolarization.
- **QRS-complex:** Detecting ventricular depolarization.
- **T-waves:** Capturing ventricular repolarization.

These detection algorithms are designed to handle diverse signal variations and noise commonly encountered in real-world ECG data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

To enhance the accuracy of wave detection, the library includes preprocessing functions to clean and filter ECG signals. This involves noise reduction, baseline correction, and other techniques to improve signal quality.

### 3. Visualization

The library provides visualization tools for ECG signals, allowing users to observe the detected waves alongside the original signal. This aids in validation and fine-tuning of the detection parameters.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the library, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install philips_ecg_wave_detection
